# Testing Your Gemini API Key

Based on the error you encountered, here are the updated steps to test your API key:

## Using the Simple Test Script

1. Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```
node simple-test.js
```

This script is designed to work with ES modules and will test your API key directly.

## Alternative: Directly Pass Your API Key

You can also test your API key without relying on the .env file:

```
node simple-test.js YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key.

## Using the Proxy Server

To run the proxy server:

1. Install the necessary packages first:

```
npm install express cors node-fetch dotenv
```

2. Start the server:

```
node server.js
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to test your API key through the server.

## Integrating with Your React App

To use the proxy server with your React app:

1. Make sure the proxy server is running
2. In your app, use the `tryBothApproaches` function from ProxyGeminiService.js

Example usage:

```javascript
import { tryBothApproaches } from "../services/ProxyGeminiService";

// In your component:
const response = await tryBothApproaches("What are common symptoms of the flu?");
```

## Common Issues

- **ES Module Issues**: Your project is configured to use ES modules, so any Node.js scripts need to use `import` instead of `require`
- **CORS Restrictions**: Browser security prevents direct API calls to Gemini, which is why a proxy server is recommended
- **API Key Format**: Ensure your API key starts with "AIza" and has no extra spaces

If you're still having trouble, try creating a new API key in the Google AI Studio.
